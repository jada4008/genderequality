      We hope the pages inform you about different issues in feminism about media and tech industries. There is also a page
      on famous feminists, women who have changed our understanding about gender equality.

    We were told to add more text to this web page, but we don't know what to add. Here are some of my favorite femnist 
    book: <i>This Bridge Called My Back</i> edited by Cherríe Moraga and Gloria E. Anzaldúa, <i>Home Girls</i> edited by Barbara Smith, and 
      <i>Bad Feminist</i> by Roxane Gay. Current feminists include Beyonce, bell hooks, and Cardi B.

  <br> “Here’s the thing that b****** got me f***** up when it comes to that word [feminist]. People think that being a feminist is a b**** that, like, went to school. They wear skirts all the way to their motherf****** ankles like a goddamn First Lady. That’s not being a feminist. Being a feminist is being equal to do what a man do. N****s hustle, and I hustle n****s.”
<br>- Cardi B
